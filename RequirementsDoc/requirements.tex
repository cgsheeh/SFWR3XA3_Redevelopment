\section*{Project Drivers}

\section{The Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}

The modern economic era is built around e-commerce and internet trade. This is apparent from the change in the speed of stock market trades, the explosion of tech based corporations and the expansion of internet commerce services such as Alibaba and eBay.

Currently, people who wish to buy and sell online are largely constrained to utilizing the services offered by the large corporations, thereby sacrificing a portion of the profit from trades. In undertaking the OpenBazaar project, we aim to benefit both online buyers and sellers by creating a platform in which internet trade can be decentralized


The project will be developed as an open-source, peer-to-peer network. 


\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The main goals of the project include:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Creating an online marketplace that is scalable, free of intermediaries and their fees, and cannot be censored.

\item
Eliminating the need for centralized e-commerce services and websites.

\item
Reducing the overhead cost of doing business and trading over the internet by using the software which will essentially make trade free again.

\item
Creating a permissionless, censorship-resistant trade platform that will connect the entire world.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Stakeholders}

\subsection{Traders}
At the present time, anyone who wishes to open an online store must use a centralized service. These services often charge listing fees, subscription fees or membership fees. Traders are also forced to use centralized exchange platforms such as PayPal or be charged bank fees for direct deposits. Traders stand to benefit from the project by the elimination of both of these unnecessary expenditures. The use of BitCoin will allow for a feeless monetary exchange and a free product listing on the OpenBazaar network.

\subsection{Buyers}
Buyers who shop online will benefit from this project in several ways. The overhead costs of doing trade will be lower on this platform than centralized services, and buyers should expect to see a reflection of this in the prices of products on OpenBazaar. Buyers will be free to exchange goods with anyone they can connect to on the network, 

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Major corporations that currently benefit from trades between buyers and sellers through the internet

\item
Collectively, law enforcement can be considered a stakeholder as they will be affected by this new form of online trade and will likely have to alter their tactics for detecting illegal online activity

\item
Members of the development team

\item
Computer/internet users in general may be considered stakeholders because, with a simpler and more effective manner of completing sales and trades readily available, more of these people may turn to internet trading
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
The hands-on users of the product:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Online Sellers/Traders

\item

\section*{Project Constraints}

\section{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}

\item
Description: The OpenBazaar client will run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. 

\item
Rationale: These are three of the most common desktop software platforms available. 

\item
Fit Criterion: The required framework and programming language must be installed (PyQT 4, Python 2).

\item
Description: In order to have full functionality a working internet connection is necessary.

\item
Rationale: The internet is the fastest way to connect buyers and sellers around the globe and exists in most modernized countries.

\item
Fit Criterion: It is required to make transactions, view markets, and discover peers on the network.

\item
Description: To make trade completely decentralized, as well as entice buyers and sellers to connect over the OpenBazaar marketplace, Bitcoin must be used as a currency. 

\item
Rationale: It is the easiest as well as one of the safest ways to make transactions over the internet. it is also becoming more and more accepted in other retail and online stores. 

\item
Fit Criterion: Users must have a Bitcoin wallet installed on their computer. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The application will be developed on Ubuntu 14, using Python 2, and PyQT as the GUI framework. The framework was chosen because of its cross-platform abilities and versatility. Ubuntu was chosen because of the compatability it has with the existing off-the-shelf softwares (OpenBazaar Server), Git, and the other partner applications that make OpenBazaar function. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\begin{itemize}

\item
BitCoin will be a vital application serving as the medium of exchange on OpenBazaar.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
There is an existing off-the-shelf software, but it is in the beta development phase, with development focus on the front end (backend complete) and testing. The front end or client side of the application will act similarily to an online classifieds system like Ebay, Amazon, Kijiji, Craigslist; however, it will be populated with only what a user would like to see.	

	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
This system is intended for use anywhere that there is a working internet connection. This enables users to connect from all around the world to buy and sell products and services. Virtually, the anticipated workplace environment is the entire civilized world.
	
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
This project should be completed and tested by November 30, 2015
\item
Learning should be focused on the PyQt4 framework, and creating wireframes for the GUI.
\item
Final documentation must be complete by December 8, 2015.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Budget Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
Not applicable.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\subsection{Definitions of All Terms}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
Python: a widely used and versatile high level programming language
\item
IDE: integrated development environment
\item
PyCharm: the chosen IDE for the project	
\item
GUI: Graphical User Interface
\item
Git: source control for the project, includes features such as revision history
\item
Bitcoin: digital store of value and online payment system
\item
Ricardian contract: used for the purpose of issuing digital currency, it is a document which states the terms under which a value is redeemable. It is readable by people, parsable by programs, and prevents unauthorized changes by making use of digitally signed and checksum hashed contracts. The contract carries keys and server information, and requires digital signatures of the issuer, a holder, and possibly a third-party notary in order for a value to be redeemed.
\item
Kademlia DHT: a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks that is designed to minimize the number of configuration messages nodes must send to learn to about other nodes.

\end{itemize}

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}


\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
It is assumed that any user of the application understands the Bitcoin currency.

\item
It is assumed that end users understand how a peer-to-peer application is different from the traditional client-server model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Facts}
\begin{itemize}
	
\item
There are existing frameworks for GUIs. PyQt in particular will be used for the implementation of the client side. 
\item
We will be focusing on developing the client side of the application due to the time constraint of this project.
	
\end{itemize} 

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
\subparagraph{Content}
A software application to connect users from all around the world to conduct trade freely is required. Users can add any peers to the network, as well as view their stores, and search for items to purchase. They will also have the ability to have their own store to sell items.
