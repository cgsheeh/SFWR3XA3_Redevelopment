\section{Introduction}
Building a decentralized e-commerce network is an exciting endeavour with many fundamentally important components. The project has a unique set of functional requirements and many equally essential non-functional requirements that must be met. From the technical perspective, we must build a distributed computer system (network) that can communicate between nodes without the use of a centralized server. We must also build a graphical front-end to display this information to the user in a visually appealing way. From an economic perspective, we must build a system to ensure that trades are well defined and that each side understands the contractual nature of the exchange. Each of these approaches to the project has different risks and considerations. 

\section{Plan}
Our plan is to implement both the server and client components of this project. We will create a daemon to listen on a computer port, which will access data from other network nodes as well as provide information to the graphical front end application. Using the graphical interface, we will allow users to create online stores, post product listings and prices, and initiate trade deals with other users on the network. 


\section{Risks}
Will a part of the implementation be difficult?\newline
The most difficult technical component of the project to develop in the given time would be creating an entire peer to peer network.
Since the idea of OpenBazaar is to be decentralized, its main requirement is that there is no main server hosting all of these peers. This would be very complex to create and maybe even beyond the scope of the project. After research we have discovered libraries in Python and Java that would allow us to use their framework in creating our peer to peer network. If this proves too difficult to implement the entire network could be simulated using hardware hiding principles.\newline
Will testing be difficult?\newline
Testing will be difficult for an implementation of a real peer to peer network. If we were to use a mock network and the MVC framework to develop the front end testing would be much easier, using something like PYUnit or Junit.\newline
Is a required library difficult to install?\newline
We have not discovered any libraries thus far that are difficult to install and use on our machine that we need in order to create this project.\newline
Will portability be a concern?\newline
Depending on which language we choose to develop this in Python or Java the user will need those languages installed. That being said we can bundle our software with the installer of those languages as needed.\newline
Will the project size/scope be feasible?\newline
Currently the scope of the project is not feasible. We need to focus on making a new front end that is much more user friendly for the average user. If we were to implement the server side as well the project would not be feasible within the given time constraint.\newline
