\section*{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the document is to describe the implementation of the OpenBazaar that was described in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that was completed earlier this semester.

\subsection{Scope}
This document describes the implementation details of all major functions that create the OpenBazaar, from every users perspective(buyer, seller, notary).

This document is intended for future developers, and designers who wish to improve or better understand the design of the OpenBazaar.

\section*{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes}
This section is intended for all possible changes that may occur to the system. They will be listed in order from most likely to least likely.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item
The hardware the OpenBazaar runs on
\item
The operating system the Openbazaar runs on
\item
The users public and private key
\item
The users role(buyer, seller, notary)
\item
The users IP Address
\item
The users Bitcoin information
\item
The users digital signature
\item
The users GUID
\item
The users market (items, price, description)
\item
The users personal settings (display picture)
\item
The algorithm to search for nodes on the network

% EXTREMELY ROUGH MODULE DECOMPOSITION
Modules for GUI 

    QMainWindow - RedevBazaar 

        Holds everything else in the application 

        RedevBazaarConnector 

    QVBoxLayout 

        Main layout for two windows 

    QLabel - Logo 

        Holds main logo, top right corner 

    Avatar photo - QLabel 

        Holds any chosen avatar logo from the user 

    QLineEdit - Search bar 

    QTabWidget 

        Holds the menus for messages, etc 

    QButton - Search 

    QListWidget - Merchant list 

    QLineEdit - Add merchants 

    QButton - Add Merchant confirm 

    QListWidget - Notary list 

    QLineEdit - Add Notary 

    QButton - Add notary confirm 

    QListWidget - Past contracts 

 
Modules for Server 
Networking 

    The server end of the application has a networking component to enable the decentralization of the application. 

    This component includes: 

        Unique GUID for network node 

            Create a public key between 1 - 2^256, derive private key from that 

            Sign own public key with private key 

            SHA256 this self-signed key 

            RIPEMD160 the SHA256 hash 

        Distributed hash table 

            Row would be GUID, dynamic IP, port, contract hash, keyword 

            Contains list of nodes within similar range. Allows for easy finding of other network nodes 

     

Ricardian Contracts 
Metadata 

    Info about contract creation date, valid period etc 

ID Module 

    Contains all user info as given by the user 

Trade module 

    Contains information regarding services/goods provided and bitcoin amount received 

Ledger Module 

    Contains info created as the contract is signed and processed, to ensure validity
