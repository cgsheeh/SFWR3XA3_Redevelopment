\part*{Introduction}
\section{Objective}
Testing the OpenBazaar application has several main goals and will span several testing domains. At the lowest level, unit testing must be completed to ensure accuracy of the application's dataflow. It is important to ensure that testing includes both white box and black box tests. White box tests will ensure that a module's secrets have been implemented adequately, and black box tests will ensure that the modules as a whole operate correctly. Further, usability testing will demonstrate the application's functionality from the perspective of use cases. Finally, security testing is essential for the application as confidential and sensitive data can be stored and transmitted via the application.

\section{Approach}
Our approach will encompass 

\section{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item[Black Box Testing]
The process of testing a function or module without taking the internal implementation into account.

\item[White Box Testing]
The process of testing which takes the internal implementation into account, and ensures it's correctness.

\item[Usability Testing]
The process of evaluating a program by testing it on users. Provides direct input on how users will interact with the system.

\item[Ricardian Contract]
A contractual agreement for a trade which aims to be exact and unchangeable. Any contract is comprised of several modules which provide information about the interaction, as well as a hash of the data to ensure that the contract is not changed retroactively. Ricardian Contract's are human readable, as well as machine parsable. 

\item[Kademlia DHT]
A distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer networks. This is the infrastructure used in the OpenBazaar application.
